# RAG-Integrating-Lectures-Research-Papers-and-PyTorch-Docs

This is the project repository for the course Systems for LLM and Agents (CSE291). his study addresses several RAG-specific challenges: 1. documents vary widely in structure (e.g., code snippets, formulas, pdfs, and slide text), terminology overlapping exists across engineering contexts and the information needed to answer graduate-level questions often spans across multiple documents.
