torch.utils.mobile_optimizer. optimize_for_mobile (script_module ,
optimization_blocklist =None, preserved_methods =None, backend='CPU' )
Optimize a torch script module for mobile deployment.
Parameters:
script_module (ScriptModule) – An instance of torch script module with type of
ScriptModule.
optimization_blocklist (Optional[set[torch._C._MobileOptimizerType]]) – A set with
type of MobileOptimizerType. When set is not passed, optimization method will run all
the optimizer pass; otherwise, optimizer method will run the optimization pass that is
not included inside optimization_blocklist.
preserved_methods (Optional[list[~AnyStr]]) – A list of methods that needed to be
preserved when freeze_module pass is invoked
backend (str) – Device type to use for running the result model (‘CPUʼ(default),
‘Vulkanʼ or ‘Metalʼ).
Returns:
A new optimized torch script module
Return type:
RecursiveScriptModuleWarning ⚠
